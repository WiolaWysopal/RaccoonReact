# Detailed Accessibility Test Report using **WAVE**

## 1. What is WAVE?

WAVE (**Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool**) is a free online tool that analyzes the accessibility of websites according to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). It highlights accessibility issues, warnings, and structural elements directly on the tested page, helping developers and designers make their websites more inclusive.

## 2. Key Terms

- **Errors (critical errors):** Indicate violations of essential accessibility rules. They can prevent people with disabilities from properly using the site (e.g., missing alternative text for images, missing headings).
- **Alerts (warnings):** Not necessarily errors but potential accessibility concerns that require manual review. They may indicate missing structures, incorrect ARIA usage, or elements needing verification.
- **Features:** Positive aspects of accessibility (e.g., language correctly defined).
- **Structure:** Hierarchical elements such as headings or regions that organize page content.
- **ARIA:** Accessibility attributes that support screen reader navigation and user interaction.

## 3. Tested Website

`URL: [https://ticktrack.work/](https://ticktrack.work/)`

## 4. WAVE Analysis Results

### 4.1 Alerts (2)

1. **No heading structure**

   - **Interpretation:** The page does not use headings (H1, H2, etc.), meaning there is no semantic hierarchy of content. Screen reader users cannot quickly understand the organization or skip to relevant sections.
   - **Recommendation:** Introduce a logical heading structure (e.g., one H1 for the main title, H2/H3 for subsections).

2. **No page regions**
   - **Interpretation:** The site lacks defined regions such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`. Without them, assistive technologies cannot easily identify navigation, main content, or complementary areas.
   - **Recommendation:** Add semantic HTML5 landmarks for clearer page structure.

### 4.2 Features (1)

1. **Language defined**
   - **Interpretation:** The primary language of the page is correctly declared in the code. This allows screen readers to apply proper pronunciation rules.
   - **Recommendation:** No change needed. Ensure correct language is declared for all content.

---

### 4.3 Structure (2)

1. **2 Inline frames (iframes)**
   - **Interpretation:** Iframes embed external content. Without titles or labels, screen readers announce them simply as “frame,” which is confusing.
   - **Recommendation:** Add descriptive `title` attributes to each iframe to explain their purpose (e.g., “Embedded video player”).

---

### 4.4 ARIA (2)

1. **ARIA label**

   - **Interpretation:** The page uses ARIA labels. If used incorrectly, they may not provide meaningful descriptions for elements, causing confusion for screen reader users.
   - **Recommendation:** Verify that each ARIA label describes the purpose of its associated element clearly.

2. **ARIA tabindex**
   - **Interpretation:** The use of `tabindex` affects keyboard navigation order. If applied incorrectly, users may experience a confusing or illogical focus sequence.
   - **Recommendation:** Use natural DOM order for navigation whenever possible. Apply `tabindex` only where necessary to improve focus flow.

---

### 4.5 Contrast

- **No contrast errors detected**
  - **Interpretation:** Text and background colors meet WCAG AA and AAA requirements (contrast ratio 8.59:1). This ensures readability for users with low vision.
  - **Recommendation:** Maintain current contrast levels. Perform manual testing if background images, gradients, or filters are used.

---

## 5. Summary of Findings

The analysis of **ticktrack.work** using WAVE revealed:

- **Critical structural issues:** No heading structure and no page regions.
- **Accessibility concerns with embedded content:** Two iframes without titles.
- **Potential ARIA issues:** Labels and tabindex require verification.
- **Positive aspects:** Correct language declaration, no contrast errors.

## 6. Recommendations

1. Add a proper heading hierarchy (H1, H2, H3) for semantic structure.
2. Define page regions with semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<footer>`).
3. Provide descriptive titles for all iframes.
4. Review and adjust ARIA attributes for correctness and logical keyboard navigation.
5. Maintain contrast compliance and test further when using background images or gradients.
